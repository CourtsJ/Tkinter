Small Projects using Tkinter

Fitts' Law:
A series of one-dimensional pointing tasks (horizontal pointing only), which is similar to Fitts' original 1954 experiment. 
Users move the cursor as quickly as possible to the green vertical bar and click on it. Clicking on the green bar causes the bars to switch colours (green turning blue, and vice versa), so users move "as quickly and accurately as possible‚Äù between clicks on the two alternating targets. Both targets always have the same width.

All combinations of distance and width are administered in a random order.

Will then log the time taken between showing the next green target and it being successfully clicked on. Each line of the log file has the following format:
    [Name] [distance] [width] [selection number] [time]


Keyboard UI
Creates a randomised keyboard in which users must click in the key given in the label.
Will then log the time taken between showing the next green target and it being successfully clicked on. Each line of the log file has the following format:
    [Name] [keyboard type] [key] [time]
